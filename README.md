## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
## The following steps are done by me to finish the Project
+ I open the github link given by udacity and I clone that Project
+ I find some files while cloning the project .The following files are:
  + Images
  + `js/app.js`,`js/engine.js`,`js/resources.js`
  + `index.html`
  + `readme.md`this are the files I found
+ I observed all the code given by **udacity** and executed the Project
+ I found some errors in console.I started solving those errors and finally I solved them.
+ After solving those errors I got a canvas on the screen
+ After observing the entire code I understand that most of the modifications will takes place in app.js
+ I had declared a class called **heroine** to intialize the player .I had taken `three` parameters which declares the x nd Y positions of player and `speed `declares speed of the player.
+ I declared the function called **handleInput** in order to declare the operations what we need to perform in after clicking a key.
+ Before that I added EventListener to all the keys .
+ Keys will be used to operate the player.I used enemysprites as bugs .while operating the player whenever the player touches the game will restart.
+ I used the logic that is the player will changes based on the score.
If the score is 10 then the game will ends.
